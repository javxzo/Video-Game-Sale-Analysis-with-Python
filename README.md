# 🎮 Video Game Sales with Ratings Analysis

## 📚 Overview

This was made and done entirely to practice Python again! All my previous projects have been centralized on Power Bi and Tableau so, I wanted to go back and practice Python for a bit. The report still needs to be completed but I got to practice some key libraries - Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly... Check out more below!

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Name`: Name of the video game
- `Platform`: Gaming platform (e.g., PS4, Xbox)
- `Year_of_Release`: Release year of the game
- `Genre`: Genre of the game (e.g., Action, Adventure)
- `Publisher`: Publisher of the game
- `NA_Sales`: Sales in North America (in millions)
- `EU_Sales`: Sales in Europe (in millions)

- `User_Count`: Number of user reviews
- `Developer`: Developer of the game
- `Rating`: Rating of the game (e.g., E for Everyone)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

This analysis utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: 🐍 Programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: 📊 Data analysis library for data cleaning and preparation.
- **NumPy**: 🔢 Library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: 📈 Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: 🧳 Data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **Plotly**: 📉 Interactive graphing library for creating dynamic and interactive plots.

## ❓ Questions and Analysis

The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. **Which genres of video games have the highest global sales, and how does this relate to their critic and user scores?** 🎮
   - Analyzed the top-selling genres and compared their global sales with average critic and user scores.

2. **Which publishers have the highest global sales, and how do their average critic and user scores compare?** 🏆
   - Identified the top publishers by global sales and compared their average critic and user scores.

3. **How do sales and scores vary by platform?** 📉
   - Compared sales and scores across different gaming platforms.

4. **What is the trend of global sales over the years?** 📅
   - Examined the trend of global sales over time and visualized changes across different years.

5. **How do critic and user scores compare across different genres?** 📝
   - Compared critic and user scores across various game genres to identify patterns and trends.
